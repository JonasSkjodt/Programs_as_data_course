in 7.2, why is it when we have only have sump set to int sump, instead of sump = 0. Why does it give 36 instead of 37. 

when to do addresses and pointers properly?

void squares(int n, int arr[]) {
    int i;
    i = 0;

    while(i < n) {
        arr[i] = i * i;
        i = i + 1;
    }
}
ref to AA_ex7_2_2.c why cant we insert <= in the while loop? right now it gives us an error "System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary."
but it works fine with while (i < n) and still gives the correct answer of 2470. is < incluces?

in the book, in the book from 2012 it says
Exercise 7.5 Extend the micro-C lexer and parser to accept ++e and --e also, and
to build the corresponding abstract syntax.

in the book from 2017 it says
Exercise 7.5 Extend the micro-C lexer and parser to accept ++e and -e also, and
to build the corresponding abstract syntax.

ie with --e from 2012 and in 2017 it says -e
