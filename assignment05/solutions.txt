5.1 
The F# merge function was created in the chap5.fsx file (see image ex5.1.png for results)
The java merge method was created in LinkedList.java and its results printed from main

5.7
We changed TypL to accept a list in TypedFun/TypedFun.fs
and then wondered what to do

6.1
we added our solutions as comments above the tests in ParseAndRunHigher.fs from line 63 to 95. (revise this later)

6.2
We added Fun of string * expr to Absyn
Then we added  | "->"            { ARROW } to FunLex.fsl

To FunPar.fsy we added

    %token FUN ARROW

and 

    | FUN NAME ARROW Expr                 { Fun($2, $4)            }

we then changed eval to accept Fun(x, body) and tested it with test2 and test3 in HigherFun.fs.
See image ex6.2.png for results
