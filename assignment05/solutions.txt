5.1 
The F# merge function was created in the chap5.fsx file (see image ex5.1.png for results)
The java merge method was created in LinkedList.java and its results printed from main



5.7
We made changes to the recursive call to typ to check the type TypL.
We then made tests called ex7, ex8, and typestest.
Their result is found in the image ex5_7.png



6.1
we added our solutions as comments above the tests in ParseAndRunHigher.fs from line 63 to 95.
We inserted the result of running the functions in the image ex.6_1.png.

Ex10 
val it: HigherFun.value = Int 7
looks good!

Ex11
This function should be 7 since addtwo is a higher order function
val it: HigherFun.value = Int 7

Ex12
yes it is expected, although let x = 77 introduces x with the value of 77,
it does not affect the function addtwo due to not being in the same enclosure as the higher order function.
So the result is 7 from addtwo 5.

Ex13
In this one function f doesnt have any value to add to x and therefore
the function will be shown instead of a value.



6.2
We added Fun of string * expr to Absyn
Then we added  | "->"            { ARROW } to FunLex.fsl

To FunPar.fsy we added

    %token FUN ARROW

and 

    | FUN NAME ARROW Expr                 { Fun($2, $4)            }

we then changed eval to accept Fun(x, body) and tested it with test2 and test3 in HigherFun.fs.
See image ex6_2_1.png and ex6_2.png for results



6.3
We added tests for it in ParseAndRunHigher called ex16 and ex17
See image ex6_3 for results



6.4
See image ex6_4_1.png and ex6_4_2.png for results. (see note explain_type_note)



6.5 (1)
(1)
inferType (fromString "let f x = 1 in f f end");;
Works fine, gives type int back. It has a val it: string = "int"

(2)
inferType (fromString "let f g = g g in f end");;
type error: circularity
circularity: function parameter g cannot be applied to itself (type failure, g cant be polymorphic in body of f)

(3)
inferType (fromString "let f x = let g y = y in g false end in f 42 end");;
Works fine, gives type bool back. It has a val it: string = "bool"

(4)
inferType (fromString "let f x = let g y = if true then y else x in g false end in f 42 end");;
System.Exception: type error: bool and int
There's a conflict because it expects to have the same return type.
From the code above, it has a chance to return a bool or an int, which results in an error.

(5)
inferType (fromString "let f x = let g y = if true then y else x in g false end in f true end");;
Works fine, gives type bool back. It has a val it: string = "bool"
