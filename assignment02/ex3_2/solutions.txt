Exercise 3.2
Write a regular expression that recognizes all sequences consisting of a and b
where two aâ€™s are always separated by at least one b. For instance, these four strings
are legal: b, a, ba, ababbbaba; but these two strings are illegal: aa, babaa.
Construct the corresponding NFA. Try to find a DFA corresponding to the NFA.

regex: (b*ab|b)*a?
NFA to DFA (see attachment picture ex3_2_nfa_to_dfa.jpg)
