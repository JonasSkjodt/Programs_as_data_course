4.1
Going through the readme.txt shows everything is working fine.

4.2
in the first 3 exercises we created the functions to make it work.
In the 4th eval was changed from:
    let fBodyEnv = (x, xVal) :: (f, fClosure) :: fDeclEnv (static)
    to 
    let fBodyEnv = (x, xVal) :: (f, fClosure) :: env (dynamic)
This ensured that the var "i" always was using the last sat value in "i".

See image ex4.2.png for the results.


4.3
We modified eval



4.4
POW, MAX2 and MAX3 inserted. See image ex4_4.png for fsi results.

eval was changed back to fDeclEnv (static) from env (dynamic)
