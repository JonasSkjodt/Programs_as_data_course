4.1
Going through the readme.txt shows everything is working fine.

4.2
in the first 3 exercises we created the functions to make it work.
In the 4th eval was changed from:
    let fBodyEnv = (x, xVal) :: (f, fClosure) :: fDeclEnv (static)
    to 
    let fBodyEnv = (x, xVal) :: (f, fClosure) :: env (dynamic)
This ensured that the var "i" always was using the last sat value in "i".

See image ex4.2.png for the results.
