POW, MAX2 and MAX3 works.

1: In FunPar.fsy

AtExpr:
  | LET NAME EQ Expr IN Expr END        { Let($2, $4, $6)        }
  | LET NAME ParamList EQ Expr IN Expr END { Letfun($2, $3, $5, $7) }
;

Got from this: https://www.partario.com/blog/2009/05/lisp-compiler-in-f-parsing-with-fslex-and-fsyacc.html
ParamList:
    NAME             { [$1] }
  | ParamList NAME   { $1 @ [$2] }

Note: It is important that even in the fsy file, fsharp can be written and executed. Like so:

AppExpr:
    AtExpr                              { $1 }
    | AppExpr AtExpr                    { match $1 with
                                          | Call(f, args) -> Call(f, args @ [$2])
                                          | _ -> Call($1, [$2]) }

Eksample for the above:
f is parsed as an AtExpr.
f x is parsed as Call(f, [x]).
f x y is parsed as Call(f, [x, y]).


2:in eval let fbodyEnv was changed back to fDeclEnv from env

| Closure (f, xs, fBody, fDeclEnv) -> 
        let xVals = List.map (fun eArg -> Int(eval eArg env)) eArgs // xVals now takes all elements of the list and gets int value from the element and adds it to a new list. 
        let fBodyEnv = List.zip xs xVals @ (f, fClosure) :: fDeclEnv // List.zip takes two lists and combines them into a list of tuples.
        eval fBody fBodyEnv


3: in parse there are tests now

then run it with run ex6;;, dont forget to open these before that

open Absyn;;
open Fun;;
open FunLex;;
open FunPar;;
open Parse;;
